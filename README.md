# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data about marketing campaign information for a bank to get clients to subscribe to a banking deposit. We seek to predict the outcome variable (y) which is the client saying yes to subscribing to a banking deposit. 

The best performing model from the AutoML run was a voting ensamble.  

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

I used hyperdrive to search for optimal parameters for a logisitc regression. First created a compute cluster using a 'Standard_d2_v2' virtual machine with a maximum of 4 nodes. Then created an early stop policy. 

The parameter sampler used was a random sampling on the inverse of the regularization strength (C) and the maximum iterations (max_iter) as shown in the starter code. 



**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
